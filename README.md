# AI in Games - Reinforcement-learning
AI in Games module group assignment. This assignment involves the implementation of reinforcement learning Algorithms to find policies for the frozen lake environment.

## Reinforcement learning algorithms implemented:
  1) Model based tabular algirthms
  2) Model free tabular algorithms
  3) Model free non-tabular algorthms
